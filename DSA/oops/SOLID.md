# SOLID PRINCIPLES

-   The SOLID Principles are a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming (especially Java)       that help developers write clean, scalable, maintainable, and extendable code.

    They were introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) and are considered best practices in object-oriented design.

# THE 5 SOLID PRINCIPLES:-

Acronym 	Name	                        Core Idea
S	      Single Responsibility Principle	A class should have only one reason to change
O	      Open/Closed Principle	            Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modify
L	      Liskov Substitution Principle	    Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
I	      Interface Segregation Principle	Don't force a class to implement interfaces it doesnâ€™t use
D	      Dependency Inversion Principle	High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
